This app is intended to be a website for a power wash business. 
I am teaching my self angular and will be adding and updating it as 
I learn more and improve. 
If you happen to come by this app, please feel free to comment, critique,
Or give me pointers. I will try and document the bugs I have as I go along.


***BUGS***
6/4 -> clicking on any service takes you to the service for the home wash instead 
The one clicked on. 
In the dark only the name shows up as input but not the other things, preferred time 
And date.
